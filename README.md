# Time Series Prediction with RNN

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`TimeSeriesPrediction-RNN.ipynb`) that demonstrates time series prediction using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented with TensorFlow.

## Overview

The notebook includes the following key components:
1. Installation of TensorFlow and its dependencies.
2. Data preprocessing for time series prediction.
3. Building and training an RNN model.
4. Evaluating the model's performance on time series data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.12 (recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow 2.19.0
- Required dependencies (see the notebook for a full list)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/time-series-prediction-rnn.git
   cd time-series-prediction-rnn
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow==2.19.0
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `TimeSeriesPrediction-RNN.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: The notebook will guide you through loading and preprocessing your time series data.
2. **Model Training**: The RNN model is built and trained on the prepared data.
3. **Prediction**: The trained model is used to make predictions on the time series data.
4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.

## Features

- **RNN Architecture**: Utilizes TensorFlow's RNN layers for sequential data prediction.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the model architecture or hyperparameters to suit your dataset.
- **Visualization**: Includes plots to visualize the training progress and predictions.
